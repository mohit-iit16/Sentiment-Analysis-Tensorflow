Dependencies:
1. Numpy
2. Tensorflow
3. Six

Tensorboard Usage:
Tensorboard functionality has not been added to this project yet. I'll include that in the future.

Model:
model consist of simple lstm cells with a logistic regression output layer.
Attention mechanism and performance results will be added in future.
